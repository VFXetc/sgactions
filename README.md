# sgactions

This Python package is a wrapper around `ActionMenuItems` in [Shotgun](http://www.shotgunsoftware.com) providing a simple interface to Python callables via a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) configuration.

It also has an optional [Greasemonkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey)-style user script to allow to injection of icons, and headings.

[Read the docs](http://sgactions.readthedocs.org/), and good luck!
